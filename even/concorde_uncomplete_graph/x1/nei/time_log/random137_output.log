Task 0: Branching on node 0
BBnode 0 split into 1 (906.12) 2 (906.50) (0.12 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 906.117647   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 1: Cutting on node 1
Writing Pool: 170 cuts
BBnode 1 (now 3) done cutting: lowerbound 907.00 (0.35 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 906.500000   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 2: Cutting on node 2
New upperbound from x-heuristic: 907.00
TOUR FOUND - upperbound is 907.00
Writing Pool: 179 cuts
BBnode 2 (now 4) can be pruned: upperbound 907.00 (0.34 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 907.000000   ACTIVE NODES: 1

Task 3: Branching on node 3
Do not branch, the lp is within 1.0 of the upperbound
BBnode 3 is pruned - no branching (0.00 seconds)
