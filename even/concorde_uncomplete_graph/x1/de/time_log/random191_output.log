Task 0: Branching on node 0
BBnode 0 split into 1 (1049.97) 2 (1049.33) (0.17 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1049.333333   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 1: Cutting on node 2
New upperbound from x-heuristic: 1050.00
TOUR FOUND - upperbound is 1050.00
Writing Pool: 509 cuts
BBnode 2 (now 3) can be pruned: upperbound 1050.00 (2.03 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1049.968000   ACTIVE NODES: 1

Task 2: Cutting on node 1
Do not cut, the lp is within 1.0 of the upperbound
Writing Pool: 509 cuts
BBnode 1 (now 4) can be pruned: upperbound 1050.00 (0.00 seconds)
