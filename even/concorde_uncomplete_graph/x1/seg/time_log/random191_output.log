Task 0: Branching on node 0
BBnode 0 split into 1 (1049.20) 2 (1049.00) (0.19 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1049.000000   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 1: Cutting on node 2
New upperbound from x-heuristic: 1049.00
TOUR FOUND - upperbound is 1049.00
Writing Pool: 284 cuts
BBnode 2 (now 3) can be pruned: upperbound 1049.00 (0.08 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1049.200000   ACTIVE NODES: 1

Task 2: Cutting on node 1
Do not cut, the lp is within 1.0 of the upperbound
Writing Pool: 284 cuts
BBnode 1 (now 4) can be pruned: upperbound 1049.00 (0.00 seconds)
