Problem Name: random10
Problem Type: TSP
Number of Nodes: 10
Explicit Lengths (CC_MATRIXNORM)
Set initial upperbound to 321 (from tour)
Basic dual change required, but no candidate edges
  LP Value  1: 321.000000  (0.00 seconds)
New lower bound: 321.000000
Final lower bound 321.000000, upper bound 321.000000
Exact lower bound: 321.000000
DIFF: 0.000000
Final LP has 10 rows, 14 columns, 28 nonzeros
Optimal Solution: 321.00
Number of bbnodes: 1
Total Running Time: 0.00 (seconds)

Standard Error:
ERROR: No dual change in basis finding code
Did not find a basic optimal solution
Fractional matching routine failed
