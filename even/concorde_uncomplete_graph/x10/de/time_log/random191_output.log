Task 0: Branching on node 0
BBnode 0 split into 1 (1049.66) 2 (1050.00) (0.13 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1049.664797   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 1: Cutting on node 1
Writing Pool: 300 cuts
BBnode 1 (now 3) done cutting: lowerbound 1050.39 (0.35 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1050.000000   ACTIVE NODES: 2

Task 2: Cutting on node 2
New upperbound from x-heuristic: 1050.00
TOUR FOUND - upperbound is 1050.00
Writing Pool: 300 cuts
BBnode 2 (now 4) can be pruned: upperbound 1050.00 (0.02 seconds)
LOWER BOUND: 1050.386364   ACTIVE NODES: 1

Task 3: Branching on node 3
Do not branch, the lp is within 1.0 of the upperbound
BBnode 3 is pruned - no branching (0.00 seconds)
